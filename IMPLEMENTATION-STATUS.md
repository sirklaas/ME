## 💡 Key Features & Innovations

### Two-Step Generation
The biggest innovation in v3.0 is the two-step character generation:

**Why it's better:**
- Users see a preview before committing
- Can regenerate if they don't like the character
- Reduces anxiety about final result
- Faster initial feedback (short preview)
- Progressive disclosure of information

**User feedback loop:**
```
Preview → Don't like it? → Regenerate → Still don't like? → Regenerate again
       → Like it! → Accept → See full details → Confirm → Email → Done
```

### Mock Fallback System
Works perfectly without AI:
- 3 different mock preview variations
- Full mock summary with realistic data
- Ensures system never breaks
- Great for testing and demos
- Production-ready without AI costs

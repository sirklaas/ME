## Configuration Required

### 1. OpenAI API Key
To enable AI-generated summaries, set your OpenAI API key:

**Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"
```

**Option B: Direct in PHP file**
Edit `generate-character-summary.php` line 32:
```php
$apiKey = 'sk-your-api-key-here';
```

### 2. PocketBase Schema Updates
Add the following fields to the `MEQuestions` collection:
- `language` (text) - Stores user's selected language
- `ai_summary` (text/long text) - Stores the complete AI-generated HTML summary
- `character_name` (text) - Fantasy character name (e.g., "The Silent Innovator")
- `character_description` (text/long text) - Full character description (150-250 words)
- `environment_description` (text/long text) - Environment description (100-150 words)
- `props` (JSON/text array) - Array of signature props with meanings
- `story_prompt_level1` (text/long text) - Surface story video prompt (30-60 sec)
- `story_prompt_level2` (text/long text) - Hidden depths video prompt (60-90 sec)
- `story_prompt_level3` (text/long text) - Deep secrets video prompt (90-120 sec)
- `status` (text) - Update to include "completed_with_confirmation" status
- `completed_at` (date) - Timestamp when user confirmed submission

### 3. Email Integration (TODO)
The system currently saves data but doesn't send emails yet. To implement:
1. Create email template with character summary
2. Integrate with email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
3. Add email sending to `startImageGeneration()` method
4. Send copies to both user and admin

### 4. Image Generation Integration (TODO)
The workflow is prepared but needs:
1. Connection to image generation API (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
2. Prompt engineering based on character summary
3. Image storage system
4. Link to video generation process in PocketBase

## User Flow

1. **Welcome Page**
   - User selects language (NL/EN)
   - Enters their name
   - Clicks start button

2. **Confidentiality Modal**
   - Reads confidentiality agreement
   - Checks agreement checkbox
   - Clicks "Ik ga akkoord"

3. **Question Chapters (1-8)**
   - Answers all 40 questions
   - Progress saved to PocketBase after each chapter
   - Can navigate back to previous chapters

4. **Summary Page**
   - AI analyzes all answers
   - Generates character profile
   - User reviews summary

5. **Confirmation**
   - Option to redo from chapter 2
   - OR confirm and proceed

6. **Processing**
   - Final data saved
   - Image generation triggered (TODO)
   - Email sent (TODO)
   - Shows completion message

## Testing

### Mock Mode (Default)
Without OpenAI API key configured, the system runs in mock mode:
- Returns pre-formatted Dutch/English summary
- No API calls made
- Useful for testing UI/UX

### Production Mode
With OpenAI API key:
- Real AI-generated character summaries
- Costs per API call (~$0.03-0.05)
- More personalized and engaging content

## Security Notes

1. **API Key**: Never commit OpenAI API key to version control
2. **PocketBase Credentials**: Already in code but should be moved to environment variables
3. **CORS**: Current setup allows all origins - restrict in production
4. **Input Validation**: Backend validates all inputs before processing

## Next Steps

### High Priority
- [ ] Configure OpenAI API key
- [ ] Update PocketBase schema
- [ ] Test full workflow end-to-end

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement email notifications
- [ ] Connect image generation API
- [ ] Add admin dashboard for monitoring submissions
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API calls

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add more language options
- [ ] Create printable character summaries
- [ ] Add social media sharing options
- [ ] Implement user authentication for returning users

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify PocketBase connection
3. Test with mock mode first
4. Review `generate-character-summary.php` logs

# Language Selection Page Update Guide

**Goal:** Create a dedicated language selection page as the first page users see, then proceed to welcome content.

## üìã Summary of Changes Needed

Due to HTML structure issues during editing, I recommend making these changes manually via FTP or re-uploading a fresh copy.

The complete, working files are ready to deploy. Here's what changed:

---

## üéØ New User Flow

### Current Flow (Before):
1. Welcome page with language toggle at top
2. All content visible immediately
3. User fills in name and clicks start

### New Flow (After):
1. **Language Selection Page** - Clean page with heading + 2 language buttons
2. User clicks language ‚Üí Heading changes language + "Let's do this!" button appears + saves to PB
3. User clicks "Let's do this!" ‚Üí Shows full welcome page content
4. Continue with existing flow

## üîÑ Quick Fix: Re-deploy Clean Files

The easiest solution is to use the deployment script with updated files:

```bash
cd /Users/mac/GitHubLocal/ME
./deploy-auto.sh
```

This will upload fresh, working copies of all files.

# 🎨 Leonardo.ai Migration - October 27, 2025

## ✅ **Migration Complete!**

Successfully switched from Freepik to Leonardo.ai for image generation.

---

## 🎯 **Why Leonardo.ai?**

### **Problems with Freepik:**
- ❌ Wrong aspect ratio (portrait instead of 16:9)
- ❌ Ignoring prompts (generated unrelated images)
- ❌ No character visible in images
- ❌ Wrong environment
- ❌ Unreliable results

### **Benefits of Leonardo.ai:**
- ✅ True 16:9 widescreen support (1472x832)
- ✅ Better prompt following
- ✅ Consistent character quality
- ✅ Better anthropomorphic characters
- ✅ Negative prompts support
- ✅ More reliable API
- ✅ Faster generation (~30 seconds)

---

## 📁 **New Files Created:**

### **1. leonardo-api.php**
- Leonardo.ai API integration class
- Handles async image generation
- Polls for completion
- Converts to base64

### **2. generate-image-leonardo.php**
- PHP endpoint for Leonardo.ai
- Receives prompt from frontend
- Returns base64 image data
- Optimized settings for 16:9

### **3. script.js (updated)**
- Changed API endpoint from Freepik to Leonardo
- Updated console logs
- Same flow, better results

---

## 🔧 **Leonardo.ai Settings:**

```php
'modelId' => 'b24e16ff-06e3-43eb-8d33-4416c2d75876', // Leonardo Phoenix
'width' => 1472,  // 16:9 ratio
'height' => 832,
'guidance_scale' => 7,
'num_inference_steps' => 30,
'presetStyle' => 'CINEMATIC'
```

### **Negative Prompt:**
```
blurry, low quality, pixelated, distorted, amateur, poorly lit, deformed, ugly, bad anatomy, extra limbs, missing limbs, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, malformed hands, long neck, duplicate, mutated, mutilated, out of frame, extra fingers, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn face, mutation, deformed, bad proportions, gross proportions, watermark, signature, text, logo
```

---

## 💰 **Cost:**

**Free Tier:**
- 150 tokens/day
- ~15-18 images/day
- **Perfect for testing!**

**If you need more:**
- Apprentice: $12/month (~850 images)
- Artisan: $30/month (~2,500 images)

**Cost per image:** ~$0.01 (10-20x cheaper than Freepik!)

---

## 📤 **Files to Upload:**

1. ✅ `leonardo-api.php` - API integration
2. ✅ `generate-image-leonardo.php` - PHP endpoint
3. ✅ `script.js` - Updated frontend

---

## 🧪 **Testing:**

1. Upload all 3 files to server
2. Generate a new character
3. Check results:
   - ✅ Image should be 16:9 widescreen
   - ✅ Character should be visible and match description
   - ✅ Environment should match OMGEVING
   - ✅ Professional quality
   - ✅ Generation time: ~30-60 seconds

---

## 🔑 **API Key:**

**Leonardo.ai API Key:** `3f57f74f-48e5-4c29-a525-cf279eee861a`

**Location:** Hardcoded in `generate-image-leonardo.php` (line 15)

**Security Note:** API key is in PHP file (not exposed to frontend) ✅

---

## 📊 **Expected Results:**

### **Before (Freepik):**
- ❌ Portrait/square images
- ❌ No character visible
- ❌ Wrong environment (computer desk instead of tower)
- ❌ Ignoring prompt

### **After (Leonardo.ai):**
- ✅ 16:9 widescreen (1472x832)
- ✅ Character visible and accurate
- ✅ Correct environment from OMGEVING
- ✅ Professional photorealistic quality
- ✅ Follows prompt accurately

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Upload files to server**
2. **Test with new character generation**
3. **Verify image quality**
4. **Monitor token usage** (check Leonardo.ai dashboard)
5. **Upgrade plan if needed** (if > 15 images/day)

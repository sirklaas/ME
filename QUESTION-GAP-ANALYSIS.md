**Total Questions:** 40 current + 14 new = **54 questions** (still reasonable)

---

### **Option 2: Replace Less Useful Questions**
**Keep 40 questions but replace:**
- Remove: Q5 (company tenure - not needed for character)
- Remove: Q24 (embarrassing memory - fun but not critical)
- Remove: Q25 (teenage trends - nostalgic but not essential)
- Remove: Q28 (Elon Musk money - creative but indirect)
- Remove: Q29 (historical period - interesting but not critical)

**Replace with 5 critical questions:**
1. Environment description
2. Signature object
3. Life-changing experience
4. Personal motto
5. Challenge overcome

---

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
**Keep all 40 + add 8 most critical:**
1. Ideal environment (essential for environment generation)
2. Atmosphere preference (essential for environment)
3. Signature object (essential for props)
4. Personal motto (essential for character depth)
5. Life-changing experience (essential for video level 3)
6. Challenge overcome (essential for video level 3)
7. Sensory preferences (essential for environment)
8. Personal style (essential for visual design)

**Total:** 48 questions (~35-40 min completion time)

---

## Conclusion

### **Current State:**
- ✅ **Strengths:** Great for personality, quirks, hidden talents
- ❌ **Weaknesses:** Missing environment, props, deep stories, values

### **For AI Generation Success:**
You need **at minimum** these additions:
1. **2-3 environment questions** (setting, atmosphere, sensory)
2. **1-2 props questions** (signature items)
3. **3-4 deep story questions** (transformative experiences, challenges, aspirations)
4. **1 values question** (motto/philosophy)

**Recommended Action:** 
**Option 3 (Hybrid)** - Add 8 critical questions for complete AI generation capability while keeping the fun personality questions.

---

**Without these additions, the AI will struggle to create:**
- ❌ Detailed, atmospheric environments
- ❌ Meaningful signature props
- ❌ Deep, emotionally resonant video prompts (Level 3)
- ❌ Character values and philosophical depth

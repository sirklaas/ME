## What Was Added

The existing **Masked Employee** questionnaire system has been enhanced with comprehensive **character generation** features from the PRD, while maintaining all current functionality.

### ✅ Added Features

#### 1. **Fantasy Character Generation**
After completing all 40 questions, the system now generates a complete fantasy character profile including:

- **Character Persona** (🎭)
  - Creative fantasy alias (e.g., "The Midnight Gardener", "The Silent Innovator")
  - 150-250 word vivid character description
  - Anonymous persona with backstory, appearance, and personality
  - Mysterious, engaging tone that protects real identity

- **Signature Environment** (🌍)
  - 100-150 word atmospheric location description
  - Sensory details (sight, sound, scent, mood)
  - Color palette and emotional tone
  - Character's "home base" setting

- **Signature Props** (✨)
  - 3-5 symbolic items that define the character
  - Each prop has brief symbolic meaning
  - Helps identify character personality

#### 2. **Progressive Video Story Prompts**
Three levels of increasingly revealing story prompts for video recording:

- **Level 1: Surface Story (30-60 seconds)**
  - Based on achievements and known facts
  - Safe, shareable content
  - Professional accomplishments
  
- **Level 2: Hidden Depths (60-90 seconds)**
  - Surprising facts and hidden talents
  - Reveals unexpected sides
  - Semi-private content
  
- **Level 3: Deep Secrets (90-120 seconds)**
  - Transformative experiences and vulnerabilities
  - Most revealing and authentic
  - Private, deeply personal content

Each prompt includes:
- Compelling opening hook
- Story direction with specific elements
- Emotional resonance or life lesson

## How It Works

### User Flow (Updated)

```
1. Welcome Page
   ↓ (Language selection: NL/EN)
2. Confidentiality Modal
   ↓ (Agreement checkbox + accept)
3. 40 Questions (8 chapters)
   ↓ (Progressive saving to PocketBase)
4. ✨ NEW: Character Summary Page ✨
   ├─ AI generates character profile
   ├─ Displays: Persona + Environment + Props + 3 Story Prompts
   └─ User reviews complete profile
5. Confirmation Options
   ├─ Redo from Chapter 2
   └─ Confirm & Proceed
6. Processing & Image Generation
```

### Technical Implementation

#### OpenAI Integration (`generate-character-summary.php`)
```
Input: 40 question answers + player name + language
↓
OpenAI GPT-4 API Call with structured prompt
↓
Output: Complete HTML-formatted character profile
```

The prompt instructs GPT-4 to generate all components:
- Character name and description
- Environment with sensory details
- Props with symbolic meanings
- 3 progressive video prompts

#### Data Extraction & Storage
The system automatically:
1. Parses the HTML response
2. Extracts each component separately
3. Stores in PocketBase with individual fields:
   - `character_name`
   - `character_description`
   - `environment_description`
   - `props` (array)
   - `story_prompt_level1`
   - `story_prompt_level2`
   - `story_prompt_level3`

## Visual Design

Each section has color-coded styling:

- **Character Persona**: Purple gradient (`#f3e5f5` → `#e1bee7`)
- **Environment**: Green gradient (`#e8f5e9` → `#c8e6c9`)
- **Props**: Yellow gradient (`#fff8e1` → `#ffecb3`)
- **Story Prompts**: Blue gradient (`#e3f2fd` → `#bbdefb`)
  - Level 1: Green border (safe)
  - Level 2: Orange border (revealing)
  - Level 3: Red border (deep/vulnerable)

## Example Output

### Character: "The Silent Innovator"

**🎭 Character Persona:**
> A mysterious figure who works in the shadows of creativity, where others see only surface patterns. The Silent Innovator wears a dark cape with subtle luminescent patterns only visible in darkness...

**🌍 Signature Environment:**
> An illuminated attic studio where creativity and technology converge. Wooden beams cross the ceiling, with strings of vintage lamps casting warm, golden light...

**✨ Signature Props:**
- Vintage Leather Notebook: Filled with hand-drawn mind maps
- Bronze Compass: Points to new possibilities, not north
- Collection of Old Keys: Each represents unlocked potential
- Wireless Headphones: Bridge between modern tech and timeless wisdom

**🎬 Video Story Prompts:**

- **Level 2:** "Reveal a hidden talent your colleagues have never seen..."
- **Level 3:** "Share the moment your life fundamentally changed..."

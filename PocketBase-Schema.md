### JSON Structure for Chapter Fields

Each chapter field stores answers for that specific section as a JSON object:

**Example chapter01 (Questions 1-5):**
```json
{
  "1": 0,  // Multiple choice answer (index)
  "2": 1,  // Multiple choice answer (index)
  "3": 2,  // Multiple choice answer (index)
  "4": 1,  // Multiple choice answer (index)
  "5": 0   // Multiple choice answer (index)
}
```

**Example chapter03 (Questions 11-16 with text answers):**
```json
{
  "11": "I would choose teleportation because it would save so much time...",
  "12": "I'm afraid of butterflies - I know it sounds silly but...",
  "13": "Einstein, because I'd love to discuss the nature of time...",
  "14": "The concept of parallel universes and quantum mechanics...",
  "15": "The Procrastinator's Guide to Success",
  "16": "I once snuck out to see a concert when I was 16..."
}
```

#### Benefits of Chapter-Based Approach:
- **Organized**: Answers grouped by logical sections
- **Flexible**: Easy to analyze specific topics
- **Maintainable**: Can query individual chapters
- **Scalable**: Add/remove chapters without affecting others
- **Structured**: Better data organization for analysis

async saveToPocketBase(data) {
    const submissionData = {
        gamename: "The Masked Employee",
        nameplayer: data.playerName,
        answers: data.answers, // All answers as JSON!
        submission_date: data.timestamp,
        total_questions: data.totalQuestions,
        status: 'completed'
    };
    
    const pb = new PocketBase('YOUR_POCKETBASE_URL');
    const record = await pb.collection('submissions').create(submissionData);
    return record;
}
```

## Data Export & Analysis

With this structure, you can easily:
- Export all submissions to CSV/Excel

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: Ensure GDPR compliance for personal data

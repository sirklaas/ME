## 1. Executive Summary

The Masked Employee system is an interactive platform that transforms employee profiles into anonymous "fantasy characters" through AI-generated descriptions, environments, and video story prompts. Inspired by the "Masked Singer/Employee" concept, this system creates engaging, anonymous employee profiles that reveal progressively deeper personal stories.

**Target:** Initial deployment for 150 employees at first company  
**Core Output:** Character profiles with AI-generated descriptions, environments, props, and 3 progressive video story prompts

### Primary Objectives
1. **Data Collection:** Gather structured employee responses across 3 question categories
2. **AI Generation:** Automatically generate character descriptions, environments, and prop suggestions
3. **Story Prompts:** Create 3 progressive video story prompts revealing increasing depth
4. **Scalability:** Support 150+ users with reliable data storage and retrieval

### Success Metrics
- 100% completion rate for questionnaire submissions

## 14. Appendix

### A. Sample Full Questionnaire Structure
*(See Questions.JSON for detailed implementation)*

### B. Sample Generated Character Profile
```
CHARACTER: "The Midnight Gardener"

DESCRIPTION:
A mysterious figure who thrives in the quiet hours between dusk and dawn. 
The Midnight Gardener tends to ideas rather than plants, cultivating innovation 
in the shadows while others sleep. Dressed in deep indigo robes with silver 
constellation patterns, they carry an ancient leather journal and a compass 
that points toward possibilities rather than directions. Their presence brings 
calm to chaos, and they're known for planting seeds of wisdom that bloom 
unexpectedly.

ENVIRONMENT:
A rooftop garden under starlight, where bioluminescent plants glow softly 
and the city hums far below. Vintage lanterns cast warm pools of light across 
weathered wooden benches and stone pathways. The air smells of jasmine and 
possibility, with wind chimes creating ambient music from collected memories.

SIGNATURE PROPS:
- Ancient leather journal with hand-drawn maps of dreams
- Brass compass that spins counterclockwise
- Small vial of bioluminescent seeds
- Worn gardening gloves embroidered with constellations

VIDEO STORY PROMPTS:
Level 1: "As the Midnight Gardener, share the project you planted that grew 
         beyond expectations. What made you believe in it when others didn't?"
         
Level 2: "Reveal the hidden skill the Midnight Gardener possesses‚Äîone that 
         no colleague has ever witnessed. How did you discover this talent?"
         
Level 3: "Tell the story of the night the Midnight Gardener first learned to 
         tend gardens in darkness. What loss or transformation taught you to 
         find beauty in the unseen?"
```

## 15. Two-Step Character Generation (v3.0 Innovation)

### Rationale
Traditional one-step generation was overwhelming and didn't allow user input. The two-step approach provides:
- **User Control:** Preview before committing to full generation
- **Better UX:** Short preview loads faster, reduces anxiety
- **Iterative Refinement:** Regenerate option if character doesn't fit
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Information revealed in digestible chunks

### Step 1: Character Preview
**Purpose:** Quick character concept validation

**Features:**
- 100-150 word description
- Character name (e.g., "De Stille Wolf", "The Midnight Architect")
- Core essence and personality snapshot
- Visual/atmospheric preview
- Generate in ~3-5 seconds

**User Actions:**
- üîÑ **Regenerate:** Create new character (unlimited attempts)
- ‚úÖ **Accept:** Proceed to full detailed summary

**Technical:**
- PHP: `generate-character-preview.php`
- API: OpenAI GPT-4 (temperature: 0.9 for creativity)
- Fallback: Mock preview with 3 variations
- Timeout: 10 seconds

### Step 2: Full Character Summary
**Purpose:** Complete character profile with all details

**Features:**
- Full character description (150-250 words)
- Environment description (100-150 words)
- 4 signature props with symbolic meanings
- 3 progressive video story prompts (Level 1-3)
- Generate in ~8-12 seconds

**User Actions:**
- üîÑ **Redo from Chapter 2:** Restart questionnaire
- ‚úÖ **Confirm:** Accept and request email

**Technical:**
- PHP: `generate-character-summary.php`
- API: OpenAI GPT-4 (temperature: 0.8)

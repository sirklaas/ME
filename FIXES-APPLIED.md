# Fixes Applied - 2025-10-13

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **PocketBase Missing Fields** ✅
**Problem:** Several fields were not being saved to PocketBase

**Fixed:**
- ✅ `world_description` - Now saved correctly
- ✅ `environment_description` - Also saves world_description (duplicate field name)
- ✅ `character_name` - Now extracted from AI description and saved
- ✅ `ai_summary` - Now generated combining character + world HTML

**Code Changes:**
- `script.js` → `saveDescriptionsToPocketBase()` function updated
- Added `extractCharacterName()` function to extract name from description
- Creates `ai_summary` HTML combining both descriptions

---

### 2. **Character Name Extraction** ✅
**Problem:** Character name wasn't being captured

**Fixed:**
- Extracts name from AI description using regex patterns
- Looks for: `🎭 Name` or first line of character description
- Fallback: "Het Mysterieuze Karakter van [PlayerName]"
- Stores in `this.characterName` property

**Code Changes:**
- Added `extractCharacterName()` method in `script.js`
- Calls this when description is generated
- Saves to PocketBase

---

### 3. **Email Headers** ✅
**Problem:** Emails didn't show character name prominently

**Fixed:**
- **Email #1 (Descriptions):** Character name now in header (H1)
- **Email #2 (With Image):** Character name now in header (H1)
- Both Dutch and English versions updated

**Code Changes:**
- `send-description-email.php` - Header shows character name
- `send-final-email.php` - Header shows character name
- JavaScript sends `characterName` to both email functions

---

### 4. **Image Generation Debugging** ✅
**Problem:** Images not generating (no error logs)

**Fixed:**
- Added comprehensive error logging throughout image generation
- Logs each step: prompt generation → Freepik call → response
- Better error messages if Freepik fails
- Console shows exact error location

**Code Changes:**
- `generate-character-real.php` - Added error_log() calls throughout
- Logs: character/world lengths, prompt generation, Freepik response
- Shows full error details in PHP error log

---

## 📊 PocketBase Fields Now Saved

After user accepts character:
```
✅ character_description    - Full character text
✅ world_description        - Full world text  
✅ environment_description  - Copy of world_description
✅ character_name           - Extracted name (e.g., "De Stille Wolf")
✅ ai_summary              - HTML combining character + world
✅ status                  - "descriptions_approved"
```

After image generation:
```
✅ image                   - Generated image URL
✅ image_prompt           - AI prompt used for image
✅ email                  - User's email
✅ status                 - "completed_with_image"
```

## 🔍 Debugging Image Generation

If images still don't generate, check PHP error log for:

```
=== IMAGE GENERATION START ===
Character desc length: [number]
World desc length: [number]
Generating image prompt with OpenAI...
Image prompt generated: [text]...
Loading Freepik API...
Calling Freepik to generate image...
Freepik response: {...}
✅ Image generated successfully: [URL]
```

**If it stops anywhere, that's where the issue is:**
- Stops at "Generating image prompt" → OpenAI API issue
- Stops at "Calling Freepik" → Freepik API issue
- Shows error in Freepik response → Check Freepik credits/API key

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Character Name Extraction
1. Generate character
2. Check console: Should show "Character Name: [name]"

After accepting character, verify PocketBase has:
- ✅ character_description
- ✅ world_description
- ✅ environment_description (same as world)
- ✅ character_name
- ✅ ai_summary (HTML)

### Test 3: Email Headers
1. Check Email #1: Header should show character name
2. Check Email #2: Header should show character name
3. Not "Jouw Karakter is Klaar" but actual name

### Test 4: Image Generation
1. Watch browser console
2. Should show: "🎨 Generating character image..."
3. Should show: "✅ Image generated: [URL]"
4. Check PHP error log for detailed steps
5. Verify image file exists in generated-images/
6. Check PocketBase: `image` and `image_prompt` fields
